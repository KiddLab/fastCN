# fastCN

A pipeline for the fast estimation of copy-number based on read depth using
the multi-mapper mrsFAST.

If you are interested in generating paralog specific copy-number estimates
consider QuicK-mer2, accessible at: https://github.com/KiddLab/QuicK-mer2

The basic functionality of fastCN is described in !(fastCN-README.txt)
